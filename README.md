# Intelligent-FAQ-Chatbot-A-user-centric-approach-using-Large-Language-Models
"This project introduces an advanced FAQ chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Unlike rule-based bots, it understands intent, adapts to context, and learns from feedback. By leveraging user data and interaction history, it personalizes responses, enhances scalability, and delivers intelligent, user-centric customer support automation."

The adoption of automated systems for customer support and information retrieval is transforming industries like education, healthcare, and e-commerce. Traditional FAQ chatbots often rely on rule-based algorithms or keyword-matching techniques, limiting their ability to address complex queries, adapt to user-specific contexts, and learn from feedback. To overcome these limitations, this project introduces a novel FAQ chatbot framework leveraging advanced models within the category of Large Language Models (LLMs). This system enhances understanding of user intent and generates natural, contextually relevant responses, moving beyond static, database-dependent answers. It incorporates user-specific data, such as preferences and interaction history, to personalize interactions and improve user satisfaction. By combining contextual understanding and personalization this framework addresses scalability challenges and delivers intelligent, user-centric automation for modern customer support and information retrieval applications.
